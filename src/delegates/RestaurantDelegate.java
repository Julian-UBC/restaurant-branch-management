 * This interface uses the delegation design pattern where instead of having

 * focus on handling the UI. The actual logic/operation will be delegated to the
 * controller class (in this case Bank).
 *
 * TerminalTransactions calls the methods that we have listed below but
 * Bank is the actual class that will implement the methods.
